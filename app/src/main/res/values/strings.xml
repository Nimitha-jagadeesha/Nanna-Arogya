    <string name="about_us_text">Smart phone has been widely used as an ideal assistant for health and fitness.we proposed a mobile application for health monitoring.Generally in critical case patients are supposed to be monitored continuously for their heart rate, blood pressure ,blood sugar level etc.In earlier cases doctors need to be present physically and the entire history cannot be displayed hence we are using a idea for continuous monitoring patients health conditions.This applications aim is to analyze users health condition and gives some suggestions and instruction to user for maintaining and improving his or her health.The app stores the data day-wise and must present the trend in increase/decrease on the levels on a weekly,monthly,yearly basis (average of week,month and year).You can add a date or pick the date.The app is also concerned of your calorie intake,if intake is not consistent then it suggests and guide you to normalize the calorie intake.</string>
